Do you remember when you were a child and had to stand in line. Well, schoolmarm is here to enforce alignment 
but only when you want to.

**Note:** eslint-config-marm version 0.2 and greater to be used with eslint v.2.0 and greater. eslint is currently v.9.~, so this config probably broken as fcuk.
